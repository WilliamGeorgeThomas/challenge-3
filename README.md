# PASSWORD GENERATOR

# Purpose

This application was created to generate random passwords between 1 and 128 characters with the option to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

# My Experience

Finishing this application from the starter code given was quite difficult. Being new to JavaScript, it has taken time to grasp it. This was a good project to understand some of the capabilities of the language.
